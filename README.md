<h1>Predicting Subscription to Term Deposit</h1>
<p>This project aims to predict whether a user will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and banking information. The dataset used for this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of 45,211 observations and 17 variables.</p>
<h2>Data Description</h2>
<p>The dataset contains the following variables:</p>
<ul>
    <li>age: Age of the user in years (numeric)</li>
    <li>job: Type of job the user has (categorical)</li>
    <li>marital: Marital status of the user (categorical)</li>
    <li>education: Educational level of the user (categorical)</li>
    <li>default: Whether the user has a credit in default or not (categorical)</li>
    <li>balance: Balance in the user's account (numeric)</li>
    <li>housing: Whether the user has a housing loan or not (categorical)</li>
    <li>loan: Whether the user has a personal loan or not (categorical)</li>
    <li>contact: Contact communication type (categorical)</li>
    <li>day: Day of the month when the user was last contacted (numeric)</li>
    <li>month: Month of the year when the user was last contacted (categorical)</li>
    <li>duration: Duration of the last contact in seconds (numeric)</li>
    <li>campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this user (numeric)</li>
    <li>pdays: Number of days that passed by after the user was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric)</li>
    <li>previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this user (numeric)</li>
    <li>poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical)</li>
    <li>y: Whether the user subscribed to a term deposit or not (categorical)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The project involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - to understand the data and detect any issues such as missing values or outliers.</li>
    <li>Feature Engineering - to transform the data and create new features that may be useful for modeling.</li>
    <li>Model Selection - to choose the best machine learning algorithm(s) for the problem and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
    <li>Model Tuning - to optimize the selected algorithm(s) by adjusting their hyperparameters and re-evaluating their performance.</li>
    <li>Model Interpretation - to understand the model's predictions and identify the most important features that influence the target variable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The project aims to achieve a high accuracy in predicting whether a user will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The selected algorithm(s) will be tuned and evaluated using appropriate metrics. The project will also provide insights into the most important features that influence the target variable.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project will help banks and other financial institutions to better understand their customers and make informed decisions regarding their marketing campaigns. By predicting whether a user is likely to subscribe to a term deposit, banks can target their marketing efforts more effectively and maximize their return on investment.</p>
